blackjack game in python for personal practice and experience in both python and github

For practice I started writing a game of blackjack in python. I want to be able to set parameters for playing and betting strategies and have the program play itself to test the strategies. I thought it would be trivial and an easy starter project! I am discovering otherwise. 

The many different examples of code available are usually pretty basic and fail to take into account betting strategies such as splitting pairs and doubling. Many don't fully account for the soft and hard total capabilities of aces or soft and hard total betting strategies. 

The exercise is also interesting to me for what I call the class paradigm - ie. do we really need classes in our code. As of this writing, my decision is no. The game itself is procedural and while it can be argued that objects exist like playing cards, decks and shoes these elements really are so trivial to create that I don't see a need to class-ify them. I make this note to record the evolution of my thinking.

I also want to animate the code in blender so I can watch games play out, purely for the enjoyment of it and the inspiration for future development this usually brings for me.

Finally the adventure has brought me here by a circuitous route. I created my account many years ago for reasons I could share if I'd taken the time and effort to record them as I am doing now. I didn't so I can't. There has been some recent suspicious activity on this dusty old account however, and the good people of Github contacted me to change my password, just in case. This in turn has nudged me to finally get my head around Github. In the many iterations of the blackjack code to date I have recklessly plunged into coding an "improvement" without saving a back-up copy of the code that actually, kinda worked. Equally as often this has left me with a version that doesn't. I have thought, often, I've gotta get into Github - doesn't that keep copies of changes to revert to? I'm about to find out.
